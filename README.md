 I would also like to thank ImageNet for putting together an sizeable image dataset of Lionfish and other species in the Caribbean Sea.

There are mutliple programs I have used to classify images of the invasive linofish species. The first one is in the folder "first_run". The final perceptron weights are saved in a .H5 file so they can be used later. You will need to install keras to run this program on a dataset of your own choosing. See https://keras.io/#installation for more info on how to setup your computer to run keras.
